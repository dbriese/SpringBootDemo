        <h3>Deirdre Briese Spring Boot Demo</h3>
         <p>I have created this SpringBootDemo application based on the PetClinic app from Spring Boot.
            My demo only has the Pet and Owner portions of the original PetClinic. I did this 
            to demonstrate my ability to successfully make and debug significant modifications 
            to a Java project.</p>
            <ul> 
              <li> Modified this app to use only the Owner and Pet classes of PetClinic. </li>     
              <li> Moved the needed classes to my project correcting references as needed.</li> 
              <li> Changed Spring Boot port to use 8082 to demonstrate knowledge of Spring Boot configuration settings</li> 
              <li> Manually added Spring Boot modules to the pom.xml </li>
              <li> Removed all Visit and Vet class references from the project to show I understand Java class interrelationship.</li>
              <li> Changed display images and text to show I understand Java project layout</li>  
			  <li> Modified tests to suit new project. Tests show solution of Mock strings to simulate database data</li>
            </ul>
