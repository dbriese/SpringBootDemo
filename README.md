# SpringBootDemo

I have created this SpringBootDemo application based on the PetClinic app from Spring Boot.
My demo only has the Pet and Owner portions of the original PetClinic. I did this 
to demonstrate my ability to successfully make and debug significant modifications 
to a Spring Boot Java project.
            
  - Modified this app to use only the Owner and Pet classes of PetClinic.
  - Moved the needed classes to my project correcting references as needed.
  - Changed Spring Boot port to use 8082 to demonstrate knowledge of Spring Boot configuration settings
  - Manually added Spring Boot modules to the pom.xml. 
  - Removed all Visit and Vet class references from the project to show I understand Java class interrelationship.
  - Changed display images and text to show I understand Java project layout
